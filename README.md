# Wavelet-Based-Learned-Scalable-Video-Coding (WL-SVC)
This repo provides the official implementation of "Wavelet-Based Learned Scalable Video Coding". It is just a preliminary version, and details will be added later. The WL-SVC ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48936648/150902487-f2288ab0-0a8d-4cb9-90b9-8b918dd59854.png)
## How To Train
1. use [Interframe EZBC-JP2K](https://ecse.rpi.edu/interframevideocoding/) to get metion vector and mask.
2. input original frame, MV and mask into python.
3. the MV bits is grenerate by [Interframe EZBC-JP2K](https://ecse.rpi.edu/interframevideocoding/) and the residual bits is generate by python.
4. Have fun!
