# Wavelet-Based-Learned-Scalable-Video-Coding (WL-SVC)
This repo provides the official implementation of "Wavelet-Based Learned Scalable Video Coding".
## How To Train/Test
1. use Interframe EZBC-JP2K https://ecse.rpi.edu/interframevideocoding/

Transform an image with transform.py. PTAHs or image SIZE need to be modified.

Reconstruct an image from iWave cofficients with inverse_transform.py. PTAHs or image SIZE need to be modified.

Have fun!
